While a project as complex as BeagleSNES can be organized and put together by one person, such an effort is only made possible by leveraging the hard work that others have already done.  The following people have all contributed to the pieces that make up the foundation that BeagleSNES is built upon:

\begin{itemize}
\item The team at \texttt{beagleboard.org}, who have developed the BeagleBoard family of hardware platforms.  Their efforts over the past several years have led to a variety of affordable, open-source hardware that is helping to encourage education and experience in embedded systems. 
\item Canonical (\texttt{http://www.canonical.com}), for their work on Ubuntu, which forms the base OS and file system environment of BeagleSNES.
\item Robert C. Nelson (\texttt{http://www.rcn-ee.com}), whose kernel work has formed the basis of BeagleSNES's kernel.  His wonderful Git repository of BeagleBoard kernel patches, as well as his numerous postings on various mailing lists and message boards, has provided a wealth of knowledge regarding the BB-xM platform.
\item The SDL library team (\texttt{http://www.libsdl.org}), for their on-going work in providing a straight-forward interface to the low-level multimedia systems of both desktop and embedded platforms.
\item The SNES9X team (\texttt{http://www.snes9x.com}), for their excellent, cross-platform SNES emulator. 
\item Yann Morin, for \texttt{crosstool-NG} (\texttt{http://crosstool-ng.org}), the cross-compiler toolchain-building scripts that have made the process of building a cross-compiler for BeagleSNES's development a snap. 
\item Petr Stetiar, for his \texttt{beagleboard-uboot-logo} project (\texttt{https://github.com/ynezz}) that served as a starting place for the bootloader splash screen code in BeagleSNES.
\end{itemize}

\noindent{}There is more to BeagleSNES than just code.  The following people have also provided assistance and support during the development of the project:

\begin{itemize}
\item Dave Vedder at changeMode design (\texttt{http://www.chmoddesign.com}), who developed the layout and look of the game selection menu.  If you need a GUI designed, I highly recommend him.
\item Internet Janitor and Suspicious Dish of the Something Awful forums, who have provided useful feedback pertaining to the game selection menu's fonts and animations.
\item Mathias Legrand, creator of the Legrand Orange Book LaTeX template\footnote{\texttt{http://www.latextemplates.com/template/the-legrand-orange-book}} that this document was created with.
\item Elijah Hall (\texttt{http://mrkittie.newgrounds.com}), 
\item ... Genraltweet  (\texttt{http://genraltweet.newgrounds.com}), 
\item ... conorstrejcek (\texttt{http://conorstrejcek.newgrounds.com}), 
\item ... and MarioMan94 (\texttt{http://marioman94.newgrounds.com}), the creators of several pieces of music that have served as the background audio for the BeagleSNES release video trailers.
\item Robert Beagley, who has lent his surname to the cause and who has also greatly enlightened the world at large with his many philosophical musings on bacon.
\item GameFAQS (\texttt{http://www.gamefaqs.com}), for their extensive collection of SNES game box images.
\item The EECS department at Syracuse University (\texttt{http://www.syr.edu}), who gave guidance and support to the BeagleSNES project during its initial development as a graduate course project.
\end{itemize}

\noindent{}Finally, a big thank you to Nintendo\textregistered for developing the SNES hardware platform.  Over 700+ game titles were released for the SNES\footnote{\texttt{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Super\_Nintendo\_Entertainment\_System\_games}}, and it would be a shame if this fantastic platform faded away.
