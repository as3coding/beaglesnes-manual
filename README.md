BeagleSNES manual LaTeX and other manual asset files

To build the manual under Linux, make sure that you have a 
full LaTeX build system installed on your system:

# sudo apt-get install texlive-full biber

Once that is done, just run "make" in the root directory of
the project:

# make

For Windows users, install a LaTeX build system such as MikTeX
(miktex.org) to build the manual via the MikTeX GUI. The file
to open with MikTeX is the "main.tex" file.

The LaTeX book template used to write this manual is the 
"Legrande Orange Book" template written by Mathias Legrand. 
You can download the template from www.latextemplates.com.
